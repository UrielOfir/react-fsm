# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the planned future enhancements for the React Finite State Machine (FSM) project.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Add Tests**: Implement unit, integration, and Playwright tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the code.


2. **Upload to npm**: Package the project as a reusable npm module, allowing it to be easily integrated into other projects.

3. **Upload to Docker Hub**: Create a Docker image of the project and upload it to Docker Hub, making it easy to run in any environment with Docker.

4. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing and deployment process.

5. **Documentation**: Improve the project documentation, including detailed API references and usage examples.
